They are crucial for optimizing algorithms, enhancing performance, and solving complex problems in software development and computer science.\n","\n","#2 Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples?\n","   - Ans2:Mutable data types (e.g., lists) can change after creation, while immutable types (e.g., tuples) cannot be modified once created.\n","#3 What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n","  -Ans3:Lists are mutable, slower, and use more memory, while tuples are immutable, faster, and consume less memory in Python.\n","#4 Describe how dictionaries store data.\n","   -Ans4:Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs using a hash table, enabling efficient data retrieval based on unique, immutable keys.\n","#5 Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n","   -And 5:Use a set over a list for unique elements, faster membership checks, and operations like unions, intersections, and differences in Python.\n","\n","#6 What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n","    -Ans6:A string is an immutable sequence of characters, while a list is mutable and can store multiple data types in Python.\n","#7 How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n","   -And 7:Tuples ensure data integrity by being immutable, meaning their contents cannot be altered after creation, protecting data from accidental modifications.\n","#8 What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n","   -Ans 8:A hash table stores data using hash functions for fast lookups. Python dictionaries use hash tables to manage key-value pairs efficiently.\n","#9 Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n","   -An9:yes\n","#10 Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n","   -Ans 10:Strings are immutable in Python to optimize memory usage and performance, ensure thread safety, and allow strings to be used as keys in hash-based structures like dictionaries.\n","#11 What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n","   -Ans11:Dictionaries offer faster lookups, insertions, and deletions due to their hash table implementation, making them more efficient than lists for tasks involving key-based data retrieval.\n","#12 Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?\n","    -Ans12:Using a tuple is preferable when storing fixed, unchangeable data, such as coordinates (x, y, z), where data integrity and immutability are important.\n","#13 How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n","    -Ans13:Sets automatically remove duplicate values, ensuring that only unique elements are stored. Any repeated elements are discarded upon insertion.\n","#14 How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n","   -Ans 14:For lists, \"in\" checks for element presence; for dictionaries, it checks for key existence, not values or items.\n","#15 Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n","   -Ans15:No, tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be modified after creation, ensuring data integrity and consistency.\n","#16 What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n","   -\n","Ans 16;\n","A nested dictionary contains dictionaries within dictionaries. It's useful for storing hierarchical data, like user profiles with addresses. Example:\n","\n","Example= {\"name\": \"raju\", \"address\": {\"city\": \" agra\", \"zip\": \"282001\"}}\n","#17 Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary?\n","   -Ans17:Accessing elements in a dictionary has an average time complexity of O(1), due to hash-based key lookups.\n","#18 In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n","   -Ans18:Lists are preferred when order matters, or when handling a collection of items without needing fast key-based lookups or unique elements.\n","#19 Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n","   -Ans 19:Dictionaries are unordered because keys are stored in a hash table, affecting retrieval by key but not by insertion order.\n","#20 Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n","   -Ans 20:Lists retrieve data by index, while dictionaries retrieve data by key, offering faster access with key-based lookups.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"0sr_d_t8SGOR"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#1 write a code to create a string with your name and print it.\n","a =
